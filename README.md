# Curriculum Vitae

So it seems like my personal website is not enough for some entities,
so here I managed to compile on a condensed format the whole thing
that companies care about. Hopefully it will satisfy their needs.

I was sent an Word document that I had to maintain the format. Since I don't have
the Office suite and I dread working with any office software, I did the only
sensible thing I could to, which is to put all the data on a YAML file and
recreate the document as an HTML page that can be downloaded as PDF.

I also added an open source section because curiously "professional experience" only
cared about companies I worked no but said nothing about open source projects, personal
projects or private clients from freelance work. So the format had to be extended.

The CV should be accessible at [cv.zequez.space](https://cv.zequez.space)
